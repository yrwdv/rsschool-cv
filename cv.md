## About me
I started to learn front-end development in 2017. Shortly thereafter I began to work as a freelancer. In all my years at freelance I also had experience of work as a full-stack developer (PHP and Node.js), WordPress developer and several other works (which includes creating extensions for different CRM systems and creating UX/UI designs). 

Now I realized I want to to focus on a front-end development. At this stage, my main goal is to refresh old knowledge and learn new things. 

## Skills

## Code Example
Function which returns a string with the highest and the lowest number from a given string of numbers:
```

}
```
